### Memoir
I hail from a sub urban called Podili. I had most of my schooling in Andhra Pradesh, India. So I am very much familiar with South Indian culture. Thanks to all my North Indian friends(too many to mention here), I can understand and speak Hindi. In total I am comfortable with Telugu, English and Hindi languages. Though I had studied for 4 years at IIT Kharagpur, I am not at all familiar with Bengali.
