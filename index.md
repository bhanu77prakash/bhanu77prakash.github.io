### A Brief Bio
I am currently working as a Research Associate at [Big Data Experience Lab, Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I completed my Bachelor of Technology in [Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2019. I am an enthusiastic researcher in the domain of Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. In specific I am working on projects related to Sentiment Analsyis in text and improving User Experience of reading digital documents.

### Memoir
I hail from a rural area, Podili. I had most of my schooling in Andhra Pradesh, India. So I am very much familiar with South Indian culture. Thanks to all my North Indian friends(too many to mention here), I can understand and speak Hindi. In total I am comfortable with Telugu, English and Hindi languages. Though I had studied for 4 years at IIT Kharagpur, I am not at all familiar with Bengali.
